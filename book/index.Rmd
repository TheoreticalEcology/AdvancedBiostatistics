The main aim of this course can be put simply: assume we have a response variable and want to understand how this response variable is influenced by a number of other factors. We will typically use a regression model for this task. To be able to perform such an analysis at a quality that is sufficient for a scientific study, you will have to master a number of skills, in particular: 

* Understanding of the fundamental statistical indicators in regression analysis (p-value, estimator) and their quality (power, bias, error, coverage),
* Understanding what a causal effect means in a regression context, and what this means for experimental design and model selection,
* Knowing all building blocks of the "advanced GLMM framework" that helps us to correctly model our data, e.g. GLMs, random effects, GAMs, correlation structures, ...
* Knowledge of standard non-parametric evaluation methods for regression models, such as parametric and non-parametric bootstrap, cross-validation,
* and the ability to use all of these methods in an applied data analysis. 

This is what we will mainly train in this course. Don't worry if you think that this sounds too simple. We could spend an entire week to only understand the p-value alone. We will still only scratch the surface. But I want to make sure that you get an overview of these topics and are confident enough to run a realistic scientific analysis on your own. 

This course assumes that have have basic knowledge of statistical methods (tests, regressions, p-value, power, CIs, ...) and the ability to apply those in R. In Regensburg, this knowledge would be taught in the Bachelors Biology Lecture "Statistik und Bioinformatik" (lecture notes in German  [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nefr3bteve5lym7/GrundlagenDerStatistik.pdf?dl=0)), and the block course "Introduction to statistics in R". If you didn't take those or comparable courses, you should at least try to get some basic understanding of R before proceeding with this book. This [lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqzoL9-eJTNBDdKgJgJzaQcY6OXmsXAHU) from MarinStatsLectures could be a good start.
